# Background

Okay guys so I finished the UI framework as we discussed in tutorial on Wednesday.
It runs if you'd like to test it. Below are some instructions for clarity.

# How to setup your UI
Your UI will be nested into the UI framework called `Block223MainPage` as a `JPanel`.
However, I have written a superclass for you to make it easier for you to access the methods
which will change the UI. [This superclass extends `JPanel` so when you extend it your class
will also become a `JPanel`.]

## Steps
1. Create/Modify a class in the `view` package and extend `ContentPage` (`ContentPage` already extends `JPanel`).

``` java
public class PageNameOfMyUIClass extends ContentPage {
```

- Please follow the convention of placing *Page* in front of your chosen class name.
Example: *PageAdminMenu*

2. Create your constructor to take 1 parameter of type `Block223MainPage` and pass it to `super`.

``` java
public PageNameOfMyUIClass(Block223MainPage frame){
    super(frame);
    // rest of constructor code
}
```

3. Write your `JPanel` as you normally would

## Help methods that are inheirited
- **`changePage(Block223MainPage.Page desiredPage)`** this method will change the page for you
- **`createButton(String txt)`** this method will return a `JButton` that is formatted 
to follow the design style of the design style of the application.
- **`cancel()`** will return to the admin menu (for the *Cancel* button at the bottom of your UI)
- **`getSideMenuList()`** will return the `JList` which makes up the side menu.
Modifying this `JList` will display directly on the side menu.
### Updates 28/02/19
- **`createHeader(String txt)`** this method will return a formatted JLabel
[header in this case means title NOT a graphics header such as a menu]
  - `createHeader(String txt, float alignment)` this is an overlaoded version accepting
alignment in addition to text. The alignment can be one of three constants from Java's Component class:
    - *Component.CENTER_ALIGNMENT*
    - *Component.LEFT_ALIGNMENT*, or
    - *Component.RIGHT_ALIGNMENT*
  - `createHeader(String txt, float alignment, boolean padding)` another overload which accepts
padding in addition to text and alignment. It is a boolean so *true* if you want padding
*false* if you do not.
- **`createComboBox()`** this method returns a formatted JComboBox<String>
- **`createCheckBox(String txt)`** this method takes the text to go beside the check box
and returns a formatted JCheckBox (which already has the text build into it).
### Updates 28/02/19
- **`displayError(String message)`** this message displays an error following this UI's style.

## How to include your UI into `Block223MainPage` for testing
See lines 79-124 in `Block223MainPage`.
Under the case for your feature, add the line
```java
displayedPage = new PageNameOfMyUIClass(this);
```
(As shown in the comments on lines 81, 84, and 87.)  
`displayPage` is the instance variable which holds the currently dispalyed page 
which is an object of `ContentPage`.

# Notes
- I have not created methods to format/setup `JTextField` or `JSlider` so if any of you want to
implement that please share.
- The *Save* and *Load* buttons currently do not do anything.
- If you want to see a page appear, change the default value of `currentPage` (`Block223MainPage`, line 25) to `Page.adminMenu`.
- For now, just display errors using Java's `showMessageDialog`. I will try to create a custom error box
to match our design later but this is not a priority.
