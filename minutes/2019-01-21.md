# Meeting 2

Attendees: Kelly, Georges, Imane, Mathieu

## Review models

### Common 
- The relationship between User - Admin - Game is important (according to professor)
- Let's use Imane's example because she asked Gunter 

### Differences
- Sabrina added a ```GameSetting``` class, instead of ```Game```, that is associated with ```Paddle```
- Imane added ```GridSystem``` to manage cells, added compositions to model

### Other
- Discussion: ```Game``` is not specific enough, perhaps use ```SpecificGame``` or ```GameBoard```

## To ask professor
- How specific does the ```Game``` class need to be?
- Do we have simultaneous instances of ```Game``` at once? Can we select between multiple games?
- Where does the ```User``` come into play? (answered by Imane)
